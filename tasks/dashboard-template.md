summary: Choose templating engine
---
Should we use [nunjucks](http://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/api.html) which is apparently close to jinja2?

We could also use Jade.

I would be most comfortable with Handlebars.

This is a #frontend task.
And also a #backend task.
It really depends on when we do the rendering.

We can do this task #now, we do not need to wait for the hackathon to start.
